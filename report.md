Highlight 3 technical elements of the script
Explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement them in this way

In the period of mid december to mid january I've written the Superpy project trying to make to learn the most out of it. I set up the Superpy folder and then watched watched and took notes of the video's about the modules needed. 
Then made a list of all the requirements to track where I am and started building the program from the ground up. 
Used the split file structure with a seperate file for the functions and a file to test the functions.
